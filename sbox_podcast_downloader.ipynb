Have you heard of a Python library with optimized data structures and built-in operations that can speed up your data science code? This week on the show, Jodie Burchell, developer advocate for data science at JetBrains, returns to share secrets for harnessing linear algebra and NumPy for your projects.</p>\\n<p>Jodie details how most people begin their data science journey using loops to iterate over values and apply operations sequentially. We talk about how loops are friendly for beginners, being clear to read and easy to debug, but unfortunately don&rsquo;t scale well, especially with large amounts of data.</p>\\n<p>Jodie shares some of the basics of linear algebra and how to organize data into vectors. We talk about how the NumPy library leverages those concepts to improve data processing. We discuss how the library includes operations for vector and matrix addition and subtraction, and why these operations are more efficient than loops. We also cover how NumPy stores arrays in memory and when working with them is faster vs when it&rsquo;s not.</p>\\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\">\\n<p><strong>Course Spotlight:</strong> <a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/data-cleaning-with-pandas-and-numpy/\">Data Cleaning With pandas and NumPy</a></p>\\n<p>In this video course, you&rsquo;ll learn how to clean up messy data using pandas and NumPy.

This week on the show, Christopher Trudeau is here, bringing another batch of PyCoder&rsquo;s Weekly articles and projects.</p>\\n<p>We discuss a recent code conversation featuring Real Python team members Ian Currie and Geir Arne Hjelle. The video dives into the officially sanctioned way to configure your project using a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file. We cover how this relatively new approach will help you package your code for use on your system or for sharing with others.</p>\\n<p>Christopher shares a Real Python tutorial about using <code>pathlib</code> to get a list of all the files within a directory. We&rsquo;re both fans of <code>pathlib</code> and how it simplifies working with file paths. The tutorial digs into methods to recursively list all directory contents or create a conditional listing.  </p>\\n<p>We share several other articles and projects from the Python community, including an explanation of Python bytecode, an argument for always using <code>[closed, open)</code> intervals, a discussion about building the monolith before microservices, a way to parse natural language time and date expressions, and a project for posting on Mastodon.</p>\\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\">\\n<p><strong>Course Spotlight:</strong> <a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/pathlib-python/\">Using Python&rsquo;s pathlib Module</a></p>\\n<p>In this video course, you&rsquo;ll learn how to effectively work with file system paths in Python 3 using the <code>pathlib</code> module in the standard library.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Topics:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>00:00:00 &ndash; Introduction</li>\\n<li>00:02:30 &ndash; Always Use <code>[closed, open)</code> Intervals</li>\\n<li>00:07:05 &ndash; Everyday Project Packaging With <code>pyproject.toml</code></li>\\n<li>00:15:38 &ndash; Sponsor: InfluxDB</li>\\n<li>00:16:27 &ndash; How to Get a List of All Files in a Directory With Python</li>\\n<li>00:20:37 &ndash; Python Bytecode Explained</li>\\n<li>00:29:39 &ndash; Video Course Spotlight</li>\\n<li>00:30:48 &ndash; Build the Modular Monolith First</li>\\n<li>00:44:34 &ndash; toot - PyPI</li>\\n<li>00:49:58 &ndash; quickadd: Parse Natural Language Time and Date Expressions</li>\\n<li>00:53:09 &ndash; Thanks and goodbye</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Show Links:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\"https://fhur.me/posts/always-use-closed-open-intervals\">Always Use <code>[closed, open)</code> Intervals</a> &ndash; &ldquo;Intervals or ranges pop-up everywhere in the programming world.

       "     'value': '<p>There seem to be three kinds of Python developers: those unaware of type hints or have no opinion, ones that embrace them, and others who have an allergic reaction at the mention of them. Python is famously a dynamically typed language, but there are advantages to adding type hints to your code. This week on the show, we have Luciano Ramalho to discuss his recent talk titled, &ldquo;Type hints, protocols, and good sense.&rdquo;</p>\\n<p>Luciano was not a fan of type hints.  He&rsquo;s only recently come around to their potential with the introduction of protocols in PEP 544. Python has adopted a gradual type system that is optional at all levels. We discuss the advantages, pitfalls, and recent developments around type hinting in Python.</p>\\n<p>We also talk about the second edition of Luciano&rsquo;s book Fluent Python. He researched type hints in-depth for the book, which led to his recent conference talks on the subject. He also shares his experience with adding opinionated asides to the book in a fun and unique way.</p>\\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\">\\n<p><strong>Course Spotlight:</strong> <a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/python-type-checking/\">Python Type Checking</a> </p>\\n<p>In this course, you&rsquo;ll look at Python type checking. Traditionally, types have been handled by the Python interpreter in a flexible but implicit way. Recent versions of Python allow you to specify explicit type hints that can be used by different tools to help you develop your code more efficiently.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Topics:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>00:00:00 &ndash; Introduction</li>\\n<li>00:02:02 &ndash; Are you interested in creative uses for Python?</li>\\n<li>00:04:41 &ndash; Protocol: The keystone of type hints</li>\\n<li>00:08:14 &ndash; What is duck typing?</li>\\n<li>00:12:44 &ndash; Protocols declaring one method and emerging from a code base</li>\\n<li>00:17:04 &ndash; An example where type hint was too lax</li>\\n<li>00:21:20 &ndash; What if Python always had a strict type system?</li>\\n<li>00:33:23 &ndash; Sponsor: Cloudsmith</li>\\n<li>00:34:09 &ndash; Bias in companies using type hints, and projects that fail checking</li>\\n<li>00:40:27 &ndash; Background on personal use of type hints and added complexity</li>\\n<li>00:45:07 &ndash; Unsuitability of type hints for checking business rules</li>\\n<li>00:52:30 &ndash; Video Course Spotlight</li>\\n<li>00:53:46 &ndash; Fluent Python, 2nd edition</li>\\n<li>00:56:05 &ndash; Who is the intended developer for the book?</li>\\n<li>00:58:12 &ndash; Soapbox sections of the book</li>\\n<li>00:59:35 &ndash; What were things you were excited to update or add to the book?</li>\\n<li>01:05:46 &ndash; Metaprogramming portion of the book</li>\\n<li>01:08:17 &ndash; What are you excited about in the world of Python?</li>\\n<li>01:10:35 &ndash; What do you want to learn next?</li>\\n<li>01:18:41 &ndash; Shoutouts, plugs, and/or social connections</li>\\n<li>01:19:47 &ndash; Thanks and goodbye</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Show Links:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python-2nd/9781492056348/\">Fluent Python, 2nd Edition</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDDCKwP7QgQ\">Protocol: The keystone of type hints - Luciano Ramalho | PyCon US 2021</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/ramalho/type-hints-protocols-and-good-sense\">Type hints, protocols, and good sense: PyCon India 2021 - Speaker Deck</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKEjkB2bXK4&amp;list=PL2Uw4_HvXqvYk1Y5P8kryoyd83L_0Uk5K&amp;index=49&amp;t=2s\">Generate buzz with realtime FM audio synthesis - Łukasz Langa | PyCon US 2021</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://garoa.net.br/wiki/P%C3%A1gina_principal\">Garoa Hacker Clube</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://py.processing.org/tutorials/\">Processing.py - Tutorials</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0544/\">PEP 544 &ndash; Protocols: Structural subtyping (static duck typing) | Python.org</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/python/typeshed/\">typeshed: Collection of library stubs for Python, with static types</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-type-checking/#duck-types-and-protocols\">Python Type Checking (Guide) – Real Python</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocols.html\">Protocols and structural subtyping — Mypy documentation</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type\">Dependent type - Wikipedia</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/pyright\">microsoft/pyright: Static type checker for Python</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">Welcome to mypy documentation!</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0487/\">PEP 487 &ndash; Simpler customisation of class creation | Python.org</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0636/\">PEP 636 &ndash; Structural Pattern Matching: Tutorial | Python.org</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.10.html#better-error-messages\">What&rsquo;s New In Python 3.10 — Better error messages</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://flutter.dev/\">Flutter - Build apps for any screen</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://ramalho.org/wiki/doku.php?id=start/\">Ramalho.org/wiki</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ramalhoorg\">Luciano Ramalho Twitter(@ramalhoorg)</a></li>\\n</ul> <p><a href=\"https://realpython.com/join\" rel=\"payment\">Support the podcast &amp; join our community of Pythonistas</a></p>'}],\n",

This week on the show, we have Will McGugan to talk about his projects Textual and Rich.</p>\\n<p>Rich is a Python library for writing rich text to the terminal with color and style. It&rsquo;s a great tool if you want to display advanced content such as tables, markdown, and syntax-highlighted code. We talk about how Will started on the project and how it&rsquo;s developed over the years.</p>\\n<p>We also talk about Will&rsquo;s new project Textual, a TUI using much of Rich at its core. He shares how the project is coming along and what are challenges in developing this type of application.  We discuss how a TUI has more in common with CSS and web development than command line or graphical interfaces.</p>\\n<p>We also have a quick announcement at the top of the show from CPython Developer in Residence Łukasz Langa about next week&rsquo;s release of Python 3.10.</p>\\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\">\\n<p><strong>Course Spotlight:</strong> <a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/python-rock-paper-scissors-game/\">Rock, Paper, Scissors With Python: A Command Line Game</a></p>\\n<p>In this course, you&rsquo;ll learn to program rock paper scissors in Python from scratch.

Is it pandas or NumPy? Is it the Python language itself? Not really. It&rsquo;s Excel. You might argue that data scientists aren&rsquo;t using Excel as their primary tool, and you might be right. But Excel enables non-technical users, like small business owners, to gain insights into their data. In this article, Anaconda CEO Peter Wang discusses his goal of making Python and PyData the &ldquo;conceptual successor&rdquo; to Excel.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-interview-problem-parsing-csv-files/\">Python Practice Problems: Parsing CSV Files</a> &ndash; In this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll prepare for future interviews by working through a set of Python practice problems that involve CSV files. You&rsquo;ll work through the problems yourself and then compare your results with solutions developed by the Real Python team.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://austinrochford.com/posts/2021-06-10-lego-pymc3.html\">A Bayesian Analysis of Lego Prices in Python With PyMC3</a> &ndash; Follow along with this in-depth analysis of LEGO prices to see Bayesian analysis in action. Along the way, you&rsquo;ll how pooled and unpooled linear models can be used to determine if a LEGO set is fairly priced. The article is quite technical, so experience with Bayesian statistics is recommended.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67912068/why-cant-comments-appear-after-a-line-continuation-character\">Why Can&rsquo;t Comments Appear After a Line Continuation Character?</a> &ndash; Chaining together many object methods can create long tines that break the PEP 8 79-character line length recommendation. You can use <code>\\\\</code> to break the chain of methods onto individual lines, but if you want to leave comments at the end of some of the lines, you&rsquo;re out of luck. There&rsquo;s another pattern, though, that solves this.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-filter-function/\">Python&rsquo;s filter(): Extract Values From Iterables</a> &ndash; In this step-by-step tutorial, you&rsquo;ll learn how Python&rsquo;s <code>filter()</code> works and how to use it effectively in your programs. You&rsquo;ll also learn how to use list comprehension and generator expressions to replace <code>filter()</code> and make your code more Pythonic.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://opensource.com/article/21/6/teach-python-raspberry-pi\">How I Teach Python on the Raspberry Pi 400 at the Public Library</a> &ndash; Community-based programming courses are a great way to introduce folks to computer programming that otherwise may not have the means to do so. One of the barriers to learning to code is cost. You need a computer to program on, after all. But with the advent of tiny computers like the Raspberry Pi, computers aimed at education are more affordable than ever.</p>\\n<p>Projects:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/vkbo/novelWriter\">novelWriter: Cross-Platform Editor Designed for Writing Novels Built With Python and Qt</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/willmcgugan/textual\">textual: A Text User Interface With Rich as the Renderer</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Additional Links:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/27/\">Episode 27: Preparing for an Interview With Python Practice Problems</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.pymc.io/\">PyMC3: Probabilistic Programming in Python</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">Black: The uncompromising code formatter</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://opensource.com/article/21/3/raspberry-pi-400-review\">My review of the Raspberry Pi 400</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.willmcgugan.com/blog/tech/post/textual-progress/\">Will McGugan&rsquo;s Blog: Introducing Textual</a></li>\\n</ul> <p><a href=\"https://realpython.com/join\" rel=\"payment\">Support the podcast &amp; join our community of Pythonistas</a></p>'}],\n",

There&rsquo;s a lot that goes into running a hardware company. Someone has to design the hardware, code the firmware, write the documentation, not to mention administrate the company. Winterbloom does all of this with just <em>one</em> engineer — Stargirl Flowers. Learn what tools and tech Stargirl uses to run her company, and how Python fits into the big picture in more ways than one.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://realpython.com/visualizing-python-plt-scatter/\">Visualizing Data in Python Using plt.scatter()</a> &ndash; In this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll learn how to create scatter plots in Python, which are a key part of many data visualization applications.

One of those conventions — the &ldquo;sadface dedent&rdquo; — moves closing parentheses in function signatures and other block headers to their own lines. This creates a line containing nothing but &ldquo;):&rdquo;, which looks like a sad face emoji.

They&rsquo;re also a good way to share results and analysis with other people, who can alter the notebook to further explore the data themselves. But there are some limitations to notebook interactivity. That&rsquo;s where <code>ipywidgets</code> comes in! In this tutorial you&rsquo;ll learn how to create widgets like check boxes, drop-down menus, sliders, and how to handle events like button clicks.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://realpython.com/platformer-python-arcade/\">Build a Platform Game in Python With arcade</a> &ndash; Building games can be a fun way to learn new Python concepts and practice techniques you&rsquo;ve already learned. Plus, they make for great projects to share! This step-by-step tutorial shows you how to build a platform game using the <code>arcade</code> library. You&rsquo;ll learn techniques for designing levels, sourcing assets, and implementing advanced features</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://pythonspeed.com/articles/python-extension-performance/\">The Hidden Performance Overhead of Python C Extensions</a> &ndash; It&rsquo;s no secret that Python is slower than compiled languages like C, C++, and Rust. If you need a performance boost, you can write compiled Python C extensions. But there are some hidden performance costs that you should be aware of if you decide to do this. This article explains two ways that Python C extensions can actually be slower than pure Python and discusses some solutions and work around for them.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/techtofreedom/for-else-a-weird-but-useful-feature-in-python-2076d8dafad1\">For-Else: A Weird but Useful Feature in Python</a> &ndash; Python <code>for</code> loops have an unusual feature: they support an <code>else</code> block that only executes if there is no break in the loop. The pattern isn&rsquo;t used very often with the argument against it being that it is a bit weird and potentially difficult to understand. But there may be times when <code>for/else</code> makes sense. This article presents three situations where <code>for/else</code> is useful and argues that, in these situations, the pattern makes the code more readable.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-news-april-2021/\">Python News: What&rsquo;s New From April 2021?</a> &ndash; April 2021 was an eventful month in the world of Python.

Digital camera manufacturers often include different presets to simulate different kinds of film. In this article, you&rsquo;ll learn how to simulate different films on your own images using <strong>color lookup tables</strong>, or <strong>CLUT</strong>s, using NumPy and the Pillow image library.</p>\\n<p>Projects:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/felienne/hedy\">hedy: Hedy Is a Gradual Programming Language, Which Increases in Syntactic Elements Level by Level</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rafael-fuente/Python-Raytracer\">Python-Raytracer: A Basic Ray Tracer That Exploits NumPy Arrays and Functions to Work Fast</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Additional Links:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\"https://arcade.academy/index.html\">The Python Arcade Library</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/arcade-python-game-framework/\">Arcade: A Primer on the Python Game Framework</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://kenney.nl/\">Kenney: Free game assets, no strings attached</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mapeditor.org/\">Tiled: Free and Open Source, Flexible Level Editor</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/\">Episode 24: Options for Packaging Your Python Application: Wheels, Docker, and More</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/postmortemgirl/status/1270679779335794688?s=20\">Your Code Is Without a Doubt the Worst I Have Ever Run</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/02/welcoming-google-as-visionary-sponsor.html\">Welcoming Google as a Visionary Sponsor of the PSF</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://pyfound.blogspot.com/\">Welcoming Microsoft as a Visionary Sponsor</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.python.org/jobs/5317/\">Python Job Board: Project Manager - Python Packaging</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0563/\">PEP 563 &ndash; Postponed Evaluation of Annotations</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/45/\">Episode 45: Processing Images in Python With Pillow</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"http://rawtherapee.com/\">RawTherapee: A free, cross-platform raw image processing program</a></li>\\n</ul> <p><a href=\"https://realpython.com/join\" rel=\"payment\">Support the podcast &amp; join our community of Pythonistas</a></p>'}],\n",

You&rsquo;ll also learn about the main differences between regular dictionaries and ordered dictionaries.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://testdriven.io/blog/what-is-werkzeug/\">What is Werkzeug?</a> &ndash; Have you ever noticed that when you install Flask a dependency called Werkzeug is also installed? Werkzeug provides a set of utilities for building a WSGI interface in Python, which is an important part of any web application. This article will take you on a deep dive of Werkzeug and show you exactly how it works so you can have a deeper understanding of Flask applications.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://bart.degoe.de/building-a-full-text-search-engine-150-lines-of-code/\">Building a Full-Text Search Engine in 150 Lines of Python Code</a> &ndash; Go from data preparation to search engine in just a few lines of Python.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://pythonspeed.com/articles/pandas-sql-chunking/\">Loading SQL Data Into Pandas Without Running Out of Memory</a> &ndash; If you need to load a bunch of SQL query results into a Pandas DataFrame, then you might run into a problem if there are enough rows in the SQL query&rsquo;s results: it won&rsquo;t fit in RAM. Panda&rsquo;s read_sql() function has a batching option, but it loads all of the data into memory, too. So, how do you handle larger-than-memory queries with Pandas? This article will show you how!</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://giansegato.com/essays/how-i-beat-the-berlin-rental-market-with-a-python-script/\">How I Beat the Berlin Rental Market With a Python Script</a> &ndash; Learn how one Python developer used a Python script to analyze the housing market in Berlin and predict when a property would be sold or when the price would be decreased. While the article doesn&rsquo;t include a lot of technical details, it&rsquo;s a great case study of how Python, its rich ecosystem, and a little creativity can turn solving a banal problem — like searching for a new house in a crowded market — into something fun and intellectually rewarding!</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/python-vs-java-object-oriented-programming/\">Python vs Java: Object Oriented Programming</a> &ndash; You may have heard that &ldquo;everything is an object in Python.&rdquo; But what does that mean for doing object oriented programming?

You&rsquo;ll explore several practical examples of the function&rsquo;s many uses in numerical applications.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://bhupesh-v.github.io/the-unholy-way-of-using-virtual-environments/\">The Unholy Way of Using Virtual Environments</a> &ndash; If you&rsquo;ve used virtual environments before, you may have created a <code>venv/</code> folder inside the root directory of your project. This is standard, but has some downsides. Have you every thought about reversing this and putting your project inside your <code>venv/</code> folder?</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://iantayler.com/2020/12/07/storing-a-list-in-an-int/\">Storing a list in an int</a> &ndash; For a fun exercise, learn how you can leverage Python&rsquo;s unlimited integer precision to encode and store lists of any size as a single integer. Because, why not?</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://monadical.com/posts/why-use-orm.html\">Why Should You Use an ORM (Object Relational Mapper)?</a> &ndash; Budding web developers learning Model-View-Controller frameworks are taught that they should use an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) to interface with their databases. But the &ldquo;why&rdquo; is often brushed aside or omitted entirely, leaving a fledgling programmer with burning questions like &ldquo;What are ORMs, anyway?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What problems do they solve?&rdquo;</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://snarky.ca/unravelling-not-in-python/\">Unravelling <code>not</code> in Python</a> &ndash; In the next blog post in his series about Python&rsquo;s syntactic sugar, Brett Cannon tackles what would seem to be a very simple bit of syntax, but which actually requires diving into multiple layers to fully implement: <code>not</code>.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://realpython.com/courses/how-python-manages-memory/\">How Python Manages Memory</a> &ndash; Get ready for a deep dive into the internals of Python to understand how it handles memory management.

They run a weekly event on Twitch, where they are live-streaming an interactive Python course. Cecil has a background in multiple languages and technologies, and now he&rsquo;s learning Python, bringing an audience along the way!</p>\\n<p>We start things off with a listener question and jump into a conversation about building up your Python skills. Then we&rsquo;ll discuss common Python language stumbling blocks. Next we consider the importance of making personal projects, and documenting that code.</p>\\n<p>We also touch on some unique skills employers are looking for. And we discuss working through impostor syndrome.

What are the best practices if you want to start using containers for your scientific projects? This week we have Tania Allard on the show. She is a Sr. Developer Advocate at Microsoft focusing on Machine Learning, scientific computing, research and open source.</p>\\n<p>Tania has created a talk for the PyCon US 2020 which is now online. The talk is titled “Docker and Python: Making them Play Nicely and Securely for Data Science and ML.” Her talk draws on her expertise in the improvement of processes, reproducibility and transparency in research and data science. We discuss a variety of tools for making your containers more secure and results reproducible.</p>\\n<p>Tania is passionate about mentoring, open-source, and its community. She is an organizer for Mentored Sprints for Diverse Beginners, and she talks about the upcoming online sprints for PyCon US 2020.
